Hi Surendra,
 
Hope you are doing well. Am writing this mail based on the current situation at Y-Axis onsite.
 
Customer is not accepting your absence and he want 3 Engineers to be present, 6 days/week at their site. We have tried to arrange a backup engineer, but as you are aware currently no one is available. Moreover your colleagues (other 2 Engineers), each of them requesting 10 days leave for festival.
 
Hence, you have to start at least working from home, starting from 31st of December and report in office by January 10th, same has been committed and convinced the customer. Please let me know, if you have any challenges, accordingly we have to plan the Engineer availability to customer.
 
Looking forward for a positive response.
 
Regards,
Sagar.
